During my summer internship in 2017, I worked at Updox in Dublin, Ohio. During this time, one of the projects that I worked on was a style guide. The purpose of this style guide was to implement the designs from the UX/UI Designer for the next generation of software produced developed by Updox. The project uses NodeJS, ReactJS, SASS and some of Google's Material-UI.

My responsibility during this project was to design the structure of the project as well as implementing the first working version of the project. The end goal of the project is to have a private node package that Updox developers can install/add to their projects to allow them to use pre-defined elements resulting in two effects:

* Ensuring consistency in code function and appearance.
* Saving developers time by preventing the creation of already known elements.

Updox was generous enough to let me keep a copy of this project at the end of my internship.
