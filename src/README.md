This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To setup:

- Clone the repo.

- run ```yarn install``` to install packages.

- run ```yarn start``` to run.

Go to ```localhost:3000``` in your browser.

# NPM Package

The following section are my notes on how to create a npm project for this repo.

- Create a npm account
